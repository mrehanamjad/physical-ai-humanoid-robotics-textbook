# Vision-Language-Action Paradigms

## Overview

This chapter introduces Vision-Language-Action (VLA) paradigms, which combine vision, language, and action to enable more intelligent robot behavior.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the architecture of VLA models.
- Learn how to use pre-trained VLA models for robotics tasks.
- Explore the future of VLA-driven robotics.

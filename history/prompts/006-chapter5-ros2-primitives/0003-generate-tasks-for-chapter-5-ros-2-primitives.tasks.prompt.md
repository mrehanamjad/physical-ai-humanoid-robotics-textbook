## Prompt

Context for task generation: 006-chapter5-ros2-primitives

The tasks.md should be immediately executable - each task must be specific enough that an LLM can complete it without additional context.

## Response snapshot

I have generated the `tasks.md` file for "Chapter 5 – ROS 2 Communication Primitives". The file is located at `specs/006-chapter5-ros2-primitives/tasks.md`.

The tasks are broken down into the following phases:
1.  **Setup**: Creating the chapter file.
2.  **Foundational**: Research tasks.
3.  **User Story 1**: Writing the chapter content and creating diagrams.
4.  **Polish**: Review and finalization tasks.

The tasks are structured to be executed sequentially and include details on dependencies and parallel opportunities.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created a new task list for a feature.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests were run.
- 📁 Files: 
  - `specs/006-chapter5-ros2-primitives/tasks.md`
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.implement
- 🧠 Reflection: The task generation process continues to be smooth and reliable.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

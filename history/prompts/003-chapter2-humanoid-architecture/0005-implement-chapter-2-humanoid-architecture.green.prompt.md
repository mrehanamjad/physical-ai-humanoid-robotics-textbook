## Prompt

Execute the implementation plan for feature `003-chapter2-humanoid-architecture`.

## Response snapshot

I have successfully implemented the chapter "Humanoid Robotics Overview" by creating the markdown file, writing all the sections, and updating the task list.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: The new chapter is now available in the textbook.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests were run.
- 📁 Files: Created one file and updated two.
- 🔁 Next prompts: null
- 🧠 Reflection: The process went smoothly, but I had to handle the diagram creation by assuming the user would provide them. In the future, it would be great to have a tool to generate simple diagrams.

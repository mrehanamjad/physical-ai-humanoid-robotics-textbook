...

## Response snapshot

I have created the feature specification for "Chapter 1 – Physical AI Foundations and Embodied Intelligence". I have also created a checklist and validated the specification against it. The feature is now ready for the planning phase.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: A clear and detailed specification for the new feature has been created.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests were run as this was a specification creation task.
- 📁 Files: 2 files were created.
- 🔁 Next prompts: The next step would be to create a technical plan for the feature using `/sp.plan`.
- 🧠 Reflection: The process of creating a specification from a detailed description was straightforward. The template provided a good structure.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): None.
- Prompt variant (if applicable): None.
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): None.

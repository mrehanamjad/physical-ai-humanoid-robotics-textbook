## Prompt

Artifact: Chapter 21 – Navigation with Nav2 Module: Module 3: The AI–Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac) Scope: Specify the complete content, structure, and learning design for Chapter 21 only. Do NOT include chatbot design, RAG systems, backend infrastructure, analytics, or deployment details. This chapter focuses exclusively on robot navigation concepts, algorithms, and implementation using the Nav2 framework in Isaac ROS. Chapter purpose: Teach students how humanoid robots can autonomously navigate in complex environments using Nav2. Emphasize path planning, obstacle avoidance, map utilization, and integration with perception and control pipelines. Target audience: Undergraduate and graduate students with foundational knowledge in: - Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence - Robotics or related engineering fields Prerequisites: - Completion of: - Chapter 20: Visual SLAM - Chapter 19: Isaac ROS and Hardware Acceleration - Basic understanding of ROS 2 nodes, mapping, localization, and control - Familiarity with Python or C++ programming Learning objectives: By the end of this chapter, learners should be able to: - Explain the purpose and components of the Nav2 navigation stack - Set up and configure Nav2 for humanoid robot navigation - Implement global and local path planning algorithms - Integrate obstacle detection and avoidance - Utilize maps generated by Visual SLAM - Monitor and tune navigation performance for real-world deployment Chapter layout requirements: The chapter must follow a clear, learner-friendly structure using the following sections: 1. Chapter Overview - Importance of autonomous navigation in humanoid robots - Relationship between perception, planning, and control 2. Introduction to Nav2 - Architecture and key components - Global planner vs local planner - Costmaps and sensor integration - Lifecycle nodes in Nav2 3. Map-Based Navigation - Using SLAM-generated maps - Static vs dynamic environments - Coordinate frames and transformations 4. Path Planning - Global path planning: A*, Dijkstra, or other algorithms - Local path planning: obstacle avoidance and trajectory following - Integration with control loops 5. Sensor Integration - Using LiDAR, cameras, and IMUs for obstacle detection - Sensor fusion considerations - Handling noisy or partial data 6. Implementation in Isaac ROS - Node setup and topic connections - Launch files and parameter configuration - Monitoring robot state and feedback 7. Performance Optimization - Tuning parameters for speed and safety - Real-time constraints - Debugging navigation issues 8. Chapter Summary and Key Takeaways - Recap of Nav2 usage and navigation principles - Preparation for reinforcement learning and sim-to-real topics 9. Practice & Reflection - Hands-on exercises: configure Nav2 on a simulated humanoid robot - Test global and local planners in varied environments - Reflection prompts on trade-offs between path optimality and safety Content standards: - Explanations must be technically accurate and consistent - Emphasize practical, applied understanding - Define all technical terms before use - Use real-world and simulated examples Visual requirements: - Include at least: - Diagram of Nav2 node and data flow architecture - Example of path planning and obstacle avoidance visualization - Visuals must directly support comprehension Writing style: - Clear, structured, and instructional - Concept-to-practice oriented - Academic-friendly but accessible - Avoid excessive technical jargon without context Length constraints: - Target length: 3,000–4,000 words Success criteria: - Learners can configure and deploy Nav2 navigation stack - Learners understand integration of SLAM, sensors, and control - Learners can plan and execute safe paths in simulation - Chapter prepares students for reinforcement learning and sim-to-real transfer

## Response snapshot

I have created the feature specification for 'Chapter 21 – Navigation with Nav2'.

- **Branch**: `022-chapter21-navigation-nav2`
- **Specification**: `specs/022-chapter21-navigation-nav2/spec.md`
- **Checklist**: `specs/022-chapter21-navigation-nav2/checklists/requirements.md`

The specification is complete and has passed all quality checks. It is now ready for the planning phase. You can proceed with `/sp.plan`.

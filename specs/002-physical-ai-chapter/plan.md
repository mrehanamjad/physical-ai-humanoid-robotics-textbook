# Implementation Plan: Chapter 1 – Physical AI Foundations and Embodied Intelligence

**Branch**: `002-physical-ai-chapter` | **Date**: 2025-12-27 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `../specs/002-physical-ai-chapter/spec.md`

## Summary

This plan outlines the creation of "Chapter 1 – Physical AI Foundations and Embodied Intelligence." The chapter will introduce the core concepts of Physical AI, its historical context, and the principles of embodied intelligence, serving as the foundational chapter for the entire textbook. The technical approach involves creating Docusaurus Markdown pages with clear explanations, diagrams, and pseudo-code examples.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Docusaurus Markdown, Python 3.11 (for pseudo-code)
**Primary Dependencies**: Docusaurus
**Storage**: N/A
**Testing**: Peer review, student comprehension checks, diagram accuracy review, accessibility checks.
**Target Platform**: Web (via Docusaurus)
**Project Type**: Documentation
**Performance Goals**: N/A
**Constraints**: N/A
**Scale/Scope**: A single textbook chapter of approximately 3,000-4,000 words.

## Project Structure

### Documentation (this feature)

```text
specs/002-physical-ai-chapter/
├── plan.md              # This file
├── research.md          # Phase 0 output
└── tasks.md             # Phase 2 output
```

**Structure Decision**: This is a documentation-only feature. The primary artifacts will be the `plan.md`, `research.md`, and `tasks.md` files. No source code will be produced.

## Complexity Tracking

N/A - No constitution violations.
